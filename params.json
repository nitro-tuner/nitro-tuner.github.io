{"name":"Nitro","tagline":"Automatic Performance Tuning Framework","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\nNitro is a programmer-directed code variant tuning framework, jointly developed by the [University of Utah](http://www.cs.utah.edu) and [NVIDIA Research](http://research.nvidia.com).\r\n\r\nNitro provides a library interface that permits programmers to express code variants (alternative implementations of a computation) along with meta-information that aids the system in selecting among the set of variants at run time. \r\n\r\nMachine learning is employed to build a model through training on this meta-information, so that when a new input is presented, Nitro can consult the model to select the appropriate variant.\r\n\r\n**Release Update [Jul/2014]:** Code release is planned for Fall, 2014. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\nCheck out the following paper for an overview of Nitro's design, and some initial results showcasing Nitro's effectiveness.\r\n\r\n[**Nitro: A Framework for Adaptive Code Variant Tuning**](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~sauravm/docs/nitro_ipdps2014.pdf)\r\n<br />_S.
